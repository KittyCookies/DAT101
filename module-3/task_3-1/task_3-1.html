      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>When the WakeUpTime is not exactly 7 (for example 8), the program runs the text saying you missed the bus. When the WakeUpTime is exactly 7, the program runs the text saying you'll make it to the bus.</p>

      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the WakeUpTime is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>When the WakeUpTime is exactly 7, the code runs that you'll make it to the buss, but if the WakeUpTime is above 7, you'll miss the buss.</p>
      
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>If the time is less than 7, you will still make it to the buss, if the time is greater than 8, you missed the buss.</p>
      
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>The coding goes through the if statement, it fails on the first statement variable === 1. So it goes down to the next statement, variable === -1, and fails again. So after going through all statements set up, the coding has no other choice but to print out the last thing, which is the sentence "the variable is zero.".</p>
