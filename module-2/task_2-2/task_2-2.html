      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				We should use constant for values that we do not want to change, and variables for values that we want to change. No, they cannot all be constants because some values need to be updated or modified during the process.
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				You put the operations you want to be done first in parentheses. Operations in parentheses are performed before those outside parentheses.
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				Using the toFixed() method, gives us the option to choose how many decimals we want.
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				One has the decimals rounded up while the other shows every decimals onward.
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				Comparison operators return a boolean value, either TRUE or FALSE. We can check the result by using conditional statements like if-else to execute different code based on the boolean value.
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				Math.random() gives us a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). It can be used for generating random values.
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. It is useful for determining if a number is even or odd, or for wrapping around values within a certain range.
