      <li>[What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!]</li>
      <p>[An array is a container that holds multiple values.]</p>

      <li>[What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").]</li>
      <p>["Hardcode" means that you type the numbers yourself, instead of generating them automatically.]</p>

      <li>[Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.]</li>
      <p>[We first give the constant variable text, and after that give another const to use the split command to turn the words into an array.
        Then we put it through the for loop to let the code figure out the rest by the commands we use... something along that.]</p>

      <li>[Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?]</li>
      <p>[It sorts out everything more easily, and it makes it easier to have the list under control, and easily remove a name if needed.]</p>

      <li>[Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for example? 
        In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? 
        If we wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and 
        "Thursday", how would it ideally look? (I will choose the best answer to this task and reward it with 
        pizza in the cafeteria right after New Year. Remember to mark in your submission if you want to
        participate in the competition!)]</li>
      <p>[Value as in motivation throughout the week. It is higher in the weekend, because work is over, we can sit back and relax. 
        The value increases for every day in the week as the list says. WorkDays has lower value than Weekdays, as the coding says.
        If we chose the days: "Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday" the value of those days would be added together and into a final number. 
        Eksample of what it would look like: "WorkoutDays: value: 13, name: Treningsdager" 
        (ps, Yes, I want pizza!) ]</p>

      <li>[In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.]</li>
      <p>[Answer]</p>

      <li>[What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out 
        if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print 
        both parameters each time the sorting routine runs.]</li>
      <p>[Answer]</p>

      <li>[In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array contains.]</li>
      <p>[Answer]</p>
